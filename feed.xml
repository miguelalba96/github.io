This is taking into account their automatic feature extraction and inductive bias properties. Explaining the behavior these “black boxes” should not be only focused in finding... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>How to build deep neural networks using Tensorflow low level API (tf.Module)</title><link href="https://miguelalba96.github.io/posts/Tensorflow-low-level-API/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to build deep neural networks using Tensorflow low level API (tf.Module)" /><published>2021-11-28T21:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-12-30T13:56:02+01:00</updated> <id>https://miguelalba96.github.io/posts/Tensorflow-low-level-API/</id> <content src="https://miguelalba96.github.io/posts/Tensorflow-low-level-API/" /> <author> <name>Miguel Alba</name> </author> <category term="Machine Learning" /> <category term="Tensorflow" /> <summary> Introduction Just before the release of Tensorflow 2.0 (mid 2019), developing large and complex deep learning models with Tensorflow 1.x required some understanding of how static graph semantics worked using tf.Session. This usually made machine learning development processes extremely complicated, difficult to explain and understand. Because of this the enthusiasm of new deep learning practit... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Linear models 101! - Introduction</title><link href="https://miguelalba96.github.io/posts/LinearModels-intro/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Linear models 101! - Introduction" /><published>2021-10-14T01:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-11-04T16:54:13+01:00</updated> <id>https://miguelalba96.github.io/posts/LinearModels-intro/</id> <content src="https://miguelalba96.github.io/posts/LinearModels-intro/" /> <author> <name>Miguel Alba</name> </author> <category term="Statistics" /> <category term="Predictive Modeling" /> <summary> Simple Linear Regression We can express the behavior of several things around nature based on their relationships. There are several types of relationships between things, some of them could describe how to phenomenons are possibly linked, and some of them could be useful to understand the particular interaction between occurrences or situations. This interaction could produce most of the time... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Welcome!</title><link href="https://miguelalba96.github.io/posts/Welcome/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome!" /><published>2021-10-13T01:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-12-30T13:56:02+01:00</updated> <id>https://miguelalba96.github.io/posts/Welcome/</id> <content src="https://miguelalba96.github.io/posts/Welcome/" /> <author> <name>Miguel Alba</name> </author> <summary> Hi, I am Miguel, this is my website and research blog.
