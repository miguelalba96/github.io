# Always learning

I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist and Statistician, currently working as a ML engineer for image processing in the automotive industry. 

My background is in pure *Statistics* and *Data Science*. My areas of interest in ML are related to R&D of new optimization/learning strategies in domains such as computer vision, time series prediction, NLP and advanced predictive modeling.

I have had the opportunity to research and develop new techniques and solutions in several ML areas, some of my investigations and work involve improving methods and paradigms such as transfer learning, multi task models, deep adversarial robustness, generative models, deep neural networks compression and continual learning.

In statistics, I am currently researching methods and applications related to time series prediction, Bayesian inference, continuous dependence modeling (copula theory) and sampling strategies.

I am open to all types of problems that involve finding and analyzing complex patterns hidden in the data.

# Education 

### M.Sc. Data Science

*Universität Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany*

I focused my work and research on using Deep Learning to solve different problems in image classification/generation, reinforcement learning, time series prediction with NLP and signal processing. I have spent most of my time working on developing and studying methods in multi-task learning, GANs, catastrophic forgetting in deep models, transfer learning, adversarial examples and defenses and Machine learning interpretability.


### B.Sc Statistics

*Universidad Santo Tomás, Bogota, Colombia*

I centered my research interest on stochastic processes, Bayesian statistics, continuous dependence models (Copulas), multivariate time series analysis and sampling strategies. I also learned traditional Machine Learning methods and analytics.
