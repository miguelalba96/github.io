# I am always backpropagating

I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist and Statistician, currently working as a ML engineer for image processing in the automotive industry. My background is in pure Statistics and Data Science. My areas of interest in ML are related to R&D of new optimization/learning strategies in domains related to computer vision, time series prediction, NLP and advanced predictive modeling.

I have had the opportunity to research and develop new techniques and solutions in several ML areas, some of my investigations and work involve improving methods and paradigms such as transfer learning, multi task models, deep adversarial robustness, generative models, deep neural networks compression and continual learning.

In statistics, I am currently researching methods and applications related to time series prediction, Bayesian inference, continuous dependence modeling (copula theory) and sampling strategies.

I am open to all types of problems that involve finding and analyzing complex patterns hidden in the data.
