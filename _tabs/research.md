## On sparsity and elastic consolidated penalties for parameter efficient transfer learning

### Machine Learning in Clinical Neuroimaging - Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin - Department of Psychiatry and Neurosciences

This is a study of a new type of optimizer which reuse/eliminate efficiently pre-trained information transfer during fine-tuning, decreasing potential sources of overparameterization caused by fitting large deep neural networks in small datasets. We also studied the effects of removing parameter redundancy and information preservation in transfer learning settings.

**This was my master's thesis.**

## Harnessing the effects of continual regularization penalties to learn adversarial examples effectively

### Research - Universität Potsdam

We found how continual learning regularization penalties such as *Elastic weight Consolidation EWC* could improve the generalization-robustness trade-off produced by the distribution mismatch between adversarial examples and clean data. This means when fine-tuning on adversarial examples adversarial regularization penalties could improve the generalization performance on the clean data lost by standard adversarial training strategies.

## Enhanced Unsupervised-unpaired image to image translation for facial photo editing

### Research internship - Universität Potsdam/Asaphus Vision GmbH

I developed a self-regularization facial recognition loss based on Neural Style Transfer and other improved GAN techniques to decrease CycleGAN identity deformation in facial attribute translation tasks.
